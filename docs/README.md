# ProtoIP <small>0.9.0</small>

> From students to students - Instituto Politécnico de Leiria - [ESTG](https://www.ipleiria.pt/estg/)

**ProtoIP** is an open source alternative to **ProtocolSI**, offering a simple and up-to-date interface for introducing students to network programming and cryptography essentials in **C#**. Provides protocol definitions and a high level boilerplate codebase for school projects.

> **From the creator**: "First, *ProtoIP* teaches you how to drive, and then gives you tools to understand how the engine works. Not the other way around."

## Features

- **ProtoStream**: Send and receive large chunks of data in a single function call.
- **Packet Manipulation**: Low level access to packets and protocol definitions.
- **Protocol Definition**: Define your own protocols and use them in your application.
- **Cryptography**: Send and receive encrypted data using **RSA** or **AES**.
- **Client-Server Definitions**: Basic definitions for client-server applications.
- **Peer-to-Peer**: Basic definitions for peer-to-peer applications.
