# ProtoCrypto

**ProtoIP** also contains a set of tools related to **cryptography**, providing students with **easy to use** and **easy to understand** interfaces for understanding how **symetric** and **asymetric encryption** works.

**ProtoCrypto** provides students with the tools needed to implement their own **secure** protocols and applications. From **hashing** to **digital-signatures** and **key-exchange**, **ProtoCrypto** offers a range of **cryptographic primitives** and **protocols** for students to experiment with and understand their **security properties** and **limitations**.

## Symmetric cryptography

- [AES](./AES.md) - Advanced Encryption Standard

## Asymmetric cryptography

- [RSA](./RSA.md) - Rivest–Shamir–Adleman

## Hashing

- [SHA256](./SHA256.md) - Secure Hash Algorithm 256
- [MD5](./MD5.md) - Message Digest 5
